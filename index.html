            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p>
                TFAVision presents an innovative solution that addresses a critical need in urban planning and infrastructure development. We are providing the traffic engineers with a continuous data stream for non-motorist (bikes & pedestrians) traffic flow. This helps in taking major infrastructure decisions based on sound data-driven analysis.

                <strong>Bike counting</strong> is done using computer vision algorithms which tracks the bikers captured via motion sensitive cameras.
