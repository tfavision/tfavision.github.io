            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p>
                TFAVision presents an innovative solution that addresses a critical need in urban planning and infrastructure development. Non-motorist traffic that is, bicyclists and pedestrians is usually not monitored. In practise, this data is collected in form of site surveys spanning 2-4 days in a year at handful of locations. This leads to heavy extrapolation of data and does not give a true picture which a traffic engineer would ideally need. To address this, we are providing an easy way to get access to a contiinuous and accurate data stream of non-motorist data which based on which major infrastructure decisions like developing new bike lanes or repairing broken ones can be taken more reliably. For ex: Tempe transportation department spends about 300k-500k every year on bicycle infrastructure developemnt projects.  Traffic engineers often need a continuous data stream for non-motorist (bikes & pedestrians) traffic flow. This helps them in taking major infrastructure decisions based on sound data-driven analysis.
