            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p>
                Transportation departments across the US are making concentrated efforts in making cities more walkable and bikeable. This not only addresses increasing awareness for sustainability and environment-friendly alternatives but also reflects the growing tendency of people to opt for healthier lifestyle options. To do this, traffic engineers need the data for non-motorist (bicyclists & pedestrians) traffic flow to make infrastructure decisions like developing new walkways & bike lanes, repairment of existing biking infrastructure & bike lanes, and traffic density on various routes.
                We make it possible by providing traffic engineers with a continuous data stream and reliable performance at economically viable prices. Our solution uses a motion-sensitive camera combined with computer-vision-based algorithms for detecting and tracking non-motorists.

                    <p><strong>Bike detection</strong> - Computer vision algorithms tracking bikers via motion-sensitive cameras.
                    We are using motion-sensitive cameras along with custom algorithm to track bicyclists. Though CCTV-based surveillance methods are popular but they are majorly used for motorist traffic and that too on major routes. Installing CCTV cameras for monitoring non-motorist traffic on a large number of routes in a city can be unviable due to cost constraints. Therefore, existing methods of counting bikes include tube counters, induction-based loops, and pyro counters. The per unit cost of these counters can vary from $1500 to anywhere around $6000. The high cost of these counters again limits the ability of a transportation department to utilize them for non-motorist traffic flow analysis.</p>

                    <p><strong>3D scanning</strong> - Collecting high-quality 3D-Lidar data for Bicycle Infrastructure Assessment.
                    To support transportation departments in monitoring pavement conditions and biking infrastructure, we have collected a high-quality 3D-Lidar scan of the whole of Tempe city. In the coming months, we will be developing algorithms that can automatically assess the condition of existing infrastructure like cracking in pavements, signage on bike lanes, bike parking racks, movement patterns and much more.
